My way of making a better 3D printer out of the worthless Tronxy X5SA that i had. Hypercube evolution was out of the question since i didnt want to buy all new 3030 extrusion pieces. This build does loose a small amount on the XYZ axis but i think the improvements in the prints was worth it with my glass bed it prints 312x300x340, with some bed support modding it could be as much as 360x310x340 So this... is what i have so far it's running and printing great, but does need some other refinements. Running Klipper firmware.

A few extra parts needed:

designed for the Orbiter 1.5 extruder, since it is what i had at the time.

2 x 410 10mm smooth rods

2 x 480 8mm smooth rods

2 x +/- 480mm 2020 extrusion

1 x 50mm 2020 extrusion

6 x 3.5mm x 30mm rods

3 x 10x20 magnets

6 x 16 tooth pulley w/ bearings

2 x 16tooth smooth pulley w/bearings

2 x LM10UU extra long bearings

2 x Hall Effect sensors

3 x 10mm magnetic joint balls with M4 threads

10 feet +/- of 3/4" wire loom

1 x ADXL345 accelerometer

BL Touch or generic

...think i got all that, most other supplies came from the X5SA itself.
