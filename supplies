My way of making a cheap 3D printer, although parts are mostly one off. I decided to turn my worthless Tronxy X5SA into a decent printer, running klipper. This... is what i have so far.

A few extra parts needed:

2 x 410 10mm smooth rods

2 x 480 8mm smooth rods

2 x +/- 480mm 2020 extrusion

1 x 50mm 2020 extrusion

6 x 3.5mm x 30mm rods

3 x 10x20 magnets

6 x 16 tooth pulley w/ bearings

2 x 16tooth smooth pulley w/bearings

2 x LM10UU extra long bearings

2 x Hall Effect sensors

10 feet +/- of 3/4" wire loom
